## Reference

Started as one of the mini-projects of [CS414](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs414). The course was originally asked students to implemented the moves of the chess pieces, and the test cases for the chess pieces.

The instruction of setting up coverage of tests were taken from past course of [cs314](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs314). The original page was posted on Piazza.

The very first GUI set up is learnt from [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw), and his series of [JAVA SWING TUTORIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XB3in9Xqy8&list=PLfyq5A05w62_verkKr3DWKWbttvdgexH3).
