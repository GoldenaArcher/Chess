// its original square, may capture this opponent's pawn as though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture
// may only be made in [immediate] reply to such an advance, and is called an "en passant" capture.

// rook, a bishop, or a knight, of the same colour as the pawn, at the player's choice and without taking into account
// the other pieces still remaining on the chessboard. The effect of the promoted piece is immediate and permanent!

//    Pawns can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, the pawn has the option of
